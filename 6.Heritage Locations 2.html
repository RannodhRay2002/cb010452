                <h1>Sacred City of Anuradhapura</h1>
                <img src="Images\her 2 main squoosh.jpg">-->
                <p> Anuradhapura, the ancient kingdom that gave birth to Buddhism, is still a treasured pilgrimage destination after more than two centuries. Anuradhapura's surrounding lands had been occupied since<br> 1 000 BC, and the city had grown rapidly by the 5th century BC. In the third century, Emperor Ashoka's son, Mahendra, instilled Buddhism, and the city became renowned as the capital of Sri Lanka's Buddhist way of life.<br><br>
                    This sacred city was established around a cutting from the 'tree of enlightenment', the Buddha's fig tree, brought there in the 3rd century B.C. by Sanghamitta, the founder of an order of Buddhist nuns. Anuradhapura, a Ceylonese political and religious capital that flourished for 1,300 years, was abandoned after an invasion in 993. Hidden away in dense jungle for many years, the splendid site, with its palaces, monasteries and monuments, is now accessible once again.

                    <div>
                        <p>One of the major locations in the sacred city of anuradhapura is the the Ruwanwelisaya Monastery. The Ruwanweliseya is located in Anuradhapura, the ancient Sinhala capital of Sri Lanka, in the North Central Province. It was begun by King Dutugamunu (137 BC â€“ 119 BC) and completed after his death by his younger brother, King Saddhatissa.<br><br> The Ruwanweliseya is one of the world's tallest ancient monuments. Soon after the fight with King Elara, King Dutugamunu began construction on the Great Stupa. The conflict had cost a lot of money, and times were tough, yet the Mahavamsa claims that the materials needed to create the Stupa mysteriously appeared from all across the island.
                           <br><br>The Ruwanweli Seya has a base diameter of 90 meters and a height of 92 meters (300 feet). The height of the circumference is 292 meters (950 feet). The original stupa stood around 55 meters (180 feet) tall, and it had been restored by several monarchs.
                           Like most Sri Lankan Stupas, the Ruwanweliseya has been built like a bubble floating on water

                </div>
                        <p>Ruwanweliseya has been abandoned by the 19th century. Naranvitiye Sumanasara, a bhikkhu, came to the Stupa in 1873 and vowed to restore it to its former beauty on his own. He was able to obtain help and financial assistance, and he was able to rebuild the Stupa.

                            The thera created the Ruwanweliseya Restoration Society in 1902, and the last pinnacle laying ceremony took place on June 17, 1940. This was done with a chuda manikkya (Seinbu crystal) presented by Burmese Buddhists.

                        <h1>Significance of Anuradhapura</h1>
                        <p id="her-facts">The spectacular dagabas that make up Anuradhapura's ageless skyline include the skyscraping Jetavanarama, the verdurous Abhayagiri, the notable Mirisvetiya and Lankaramaya, and finally Thuparamaya - Sri Lanka's oldest dagaba, claimed to house the Lord Buddha's right collarbone.<br><br>

                            Surrounding these enormous emblems of Buddhist adoration are the well-preserved ruins that have earned Anuradhapura the UNESCO World Heritage Site designation, including hospitals, monasteries, advanced irrigation systems, and palaces like the Lovamahapaya (Brazen Palace). The Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, located in the heart of the ancient kingdom, is perhaps most significant to Anuradhapura. This sacred Bo Tree was transported to Sri Lanka in 236 BC as a scion of the tree beneath which the Lord Buddha attained enlightenment, giving it the name "Bo Tree of Enlightenment."
