                    <h1>Hiking</h1>
                 </header>
                    <img id="bea" src="Images\nature-mountains-sky-sri-lanka-wallpaper-preview.jpg">
                    <p>For many visitors, Sri Lanka is synonymous with lovely, blonde beaches, but the harsh, mountainous interior holds a different world. Vehicles replaced hiking as the primary mode of transportation on this beautiful tropical island only after railways were built across the highlands. Within striking distance of the shore, modern-day trekkers can reach a world of rocky ruins, religious places, spectacular views, and falling tea farms.<br><br>
                        Because of Sri Lanka's modest size — the island is only 268 miles long and 139 miles wide – trekkers don't have to worry about intricate logistics. For walks in national parks (and off-the-beaten-path treks elsewhere), you'll need a guide, but most hikes are easy day hikes, so you can just show up and start walking, knowing that at the end of the day, your guesthouse will have a hearty plate of rice and curry waiting for you.

                         <p>Ella is the hiking capital of the highlands, with nearly every guest house in town able to give a map of the tracks and trails that meander through the ridges to tea gardens, waterfalls, and scenic overlooks. It's easy to lose track of time strolling to lookouts and posing for photos beside the iconic Nine Arches Bridge (or watching Instagrammers do so). A fantastic, home-cooked meal awaits you at the end of a long day of walking when you stay at a guesthouse.<br><br>

                        <p>Head northeast of Kandy to the densely forested Knuckles Range for a trek off the beaten path in Sri Lanka. The UNESCO-listed Peak Wilderness Protected Area was established to conserve the island's vulnerable montane and cloud forests, and it includes this steep peak. When hiking in the Knuckles Range, you'll definitely observe more residents than tourists, as well as buffaloes, monkeys, and birds. You might even see a leopard or a wild elephant among the misty vegetation if you're lucky.<br><br>

                <h1>Whale Watching</h1>
                <img id="bea" src="Images\sl-blue-whales.jpg" width="750px" height="500px">
                <p>Blue whales are the largest mammals to have ever existed on Earth. And if you ever needed another reason to visit Sri Lanka, this is it. Sri Lanka is properly claiming its own cetacean crown, despite not being as well-known as Antarctica or the Azores for large, gorgeous blues. And you won't be able to witness our ocean's most magnificent creatures one day and elephants or leopards the next in other regions of the whale-watching world.<br><br>
                    You also don’t need to take on an expedition across great oceans, but simply enjoy glorious experiences along the south coast of the Indian Ocean’s famously beautiful ‘Teardrop Island’. And watching blue whales off Sri Lanka’s coast of Mirissa or Galle certainly will reduce you to tears.<br><br>
                
                </p>
                <h3>Where to go Whale Watching</h3>
                <p>The southern shore, particularly near Galle and Mirissa, is not only home to whale watching companies, but also to the best sites to witness the cetacean carnival. This is due to the fact that the continental shelf here is quite thin, allowing for quick and easy access to deep seas.<br><br> This stretch of the coast is also easily accessible by taking the famed coastal train excursion from Colombo to Galle, which is not just a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its ancient 16th century fort, but also a hub of funky tiny hotels, cafes, and, of course, excellent seafood.

                        <p>From November to April is the greatest time to go whale watching in Mirissa. Whales migrate from the southern to the northern hemisphere when the ocean is calm. It the off-season from May to October, the ocean is choppy, and it is not worth going. Whale sightings are quite rare.<br><br>
                            During the months of November to April, there is a 98 percent possibility of seeing whales. The most common whales spotted are blue whales. Sperm whales, fin whales, Bryde's whales, short-finned whales, dolphins, and, on rare occasions, killer whales and whale sharks can also be seen.<br><br>
                           Duration:  3-5 hours, the average duration is 4h<br><br>

                <img id="bea" src="Images\birds-of-sri-lanka-king-fis.jpg" width="750px" height="500px">
                <p>Sri Lanka stands out among other areas on the earth for bird watching and is definitely a paradise for all bird watchers. This is one of the most popular activities in Sri Lanka, particularly near the island's bird sanctuaries and wetland reserves in the south east, where the tranquil atmosphere is ideal for viewing migrating birds.<br><br>

                    More than 400 bird species call Sri Lanka home, including 23 endemics and 200 migratory birds from India, Siberia, Scandinavia, and Western Europe. The optimum time to visit the island for bird watchers is between November and April of each year. In addition, December has been designated as Sri Lanka's National Bird Month. The Kumana National Park, the Kalametiya Bird Sanctuary, the Bodhinagala Sanctuary, and Udawatte Kele are just a few of the island's many bird sanctuaries.

In addition, the area is home to a diverse spectrum of common and rare species. As a result, this is one of Sri Lanka's premier bird-watching reserves.</p>

Aside from that, there are a lot of aquatic birds.

                            This National Park is home to a variety of birds, including the Lesser Adjutant, Painted stork, and Spot-billed pelican.</p>
