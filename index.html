                        <p>Sri Lanka is an island nation off the southern coast of India in the Indian Ocean. Despite its small size—slightly larger than the state of West Virginia—Sri Lanka boasts a population of about 20 million people, nearly comparable to Texas. Natural resources abound on the island, which supports a diverse economy focused on agriculture, mining, fishing, industry, and tourism. Sri Lanka (previously known as Ceylon) appeared to be on its way to becoming a stable and wealthy democracy when it gained independence in 1948.<br><br> However, since the 1970s, the country has been ripped apart by violent conflicts between the country's two main ethnic groups, Sinhalese and Tamils. The tsunami of 2004 caused significant damage and loss of life in Sri Lanka; how that calamity would affect the country's political destiny remains to be seen.</p>

                        <p>Sri Lanka is a country with a wide range of cultural influences. Religion is present in many parts of life and is a fundamental component of this diversity. The most prominent characteristics of the cultural landscape are Buddhist and Hindu temples, as well as mosques and churches, each with their own colorful traditions.
                            The cultural mosaic is further colored by varying degrees of colonial influence, modernizing influences, and wealth and income.<br><br>Despite its evident ties to India, Sri Lanka has established a distinct character over time that has separated it apart from its southern neighbor. Due to the island's physical separation from the subcontinent, cultural elements brought from India had to flourish and change independently in Sri Lanka. Buddhism, for example, has all but vanished in India, but it has thrived in Sri Lanka, particularly among the Sinhalese. Furthermore, the Sinhalese language evolved from Indo-Aryan dialects from the mainland to become wholly indigenous to Sri Lanka, with its own literary legacy.</p>

                        <p>The Ancient Period Migrants from northern India, the progenitors of today's Sinhalese people, arrived in Sri Lanka some 2600 years ago. The Sinhalese were among the first people outside of northern India to embrace Buddhism, doing so approximately 300 B.C.E. The Buddhist kingdoms of Sri Lanka shared language and culture with northern India's classic nations, such as the Maurya (324-187 B.C.E.) and Gupta (c. 320-c.550 C.E.) empires, and maintained diplomatic and commercial ties with them.<br><br>The Buddhist kingdoms of Sri Lanka prospered by establishing and controlling irrigation networks on the island's plains in the north. Anuradhapura, one of the historic capitals of southern Asia, was home to some of the greatest and most beautiful Buddhist temples. King Kasyapa (r. 473-491), the monarch of another Sri Lankan state, made Sigiriya his capital, a natural rock stronghold rising 500 feet above the surrounding plain, on top of which the king erected a magnificent city of palaces and gardens.</p>
